i am working on the 42 project called ft_linear_regression, and i do not understand the sense of this subject. We do the hypothesis of a linear model as y = mx + p. We have a dataset, so due to courses from statistics we have formula to calculate m and p directly. So why do compute a gradient descent? The gradient descent is very interesting to code, but in that case, it is unusefull. If the goal of the subject is to code a gradient descent algo, the title should be gradient_descent and not ft_linear_regression, right?


Excellent question — and you’re 100% right to be confused at first glance.
Let’s unpack what’s going on with ft_linear_regression and why you’re being asked to do gradient descent when the “simple” formulas already exist.

🧠 The math: yes, we can compute m and p directly

For a simple linear regression y=mx+p, you can indeed compute:

Those formulas come from setting the derivative of the cost function to zero and solving analytically — it’s the closed-form solution of the least squares problem.

So if the only goal were to fit a straight line to data, that would be the most efficient way.

⚙️ The reason 42 makes you code gradient descent

The real pedagogical goal of the project isn’t to fit a line — it’s to make you understand machine learning optimization.

Machine learning in the real world almost never allows for such simple closed-form solutions.
In more complex models (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks, etc.), you can’t solve the cost function analytically.
You must approximate the minimum of the cost function numerically — and gradient descent is the fundamental way to do that.

So, the point of ft_linear_regression is:

Learn how gradient descent works by applying it to the simplest possible case (a line).

It’s a “sandbox” for optimization concepts — not a stats exercise.

💡 Why the title “ft_linear_regression” still makes sense

It’s a bit misleading, yes, but the reasoning is:

You are implementing linear regression, conceptually.

The method used to find the coefficients (gradient descent) is what’s being trained.

The focus is on learning how to optimize parameters given a cost function (the MSE).

So, “ft_linear_regression” is the application, and “gradient descent” is the technique you use.

🧩 Analogy

Imagine 42 told you to “build a car,” but the real goal was to make you understand how an engine works.
You wouldn’t just buy an engine — you’d build one from scratch to understand its moving parts.
Same here: gradient descent is the “engine” of most machine learning algorithms.

🧾 TL;DR
Question	Answer
Why not use the direct formula?	Because the goal is to understand optimization, not just fit a line.
Is gradient descent mathematically necessary here?	No, it’s overkill — but it’s educational.
Why is it called ft_linear_regression then?	Because you’re training a linear model, even though the focus is the optimization method.
So what am I really learning?	How to minimize a cost function via gradient descent — the core idea behind all ML.
